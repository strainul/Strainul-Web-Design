          <h3>HTML5 Markup</h3>
          <p>HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup based pattern to it.

            HTML5 is the fifth and current major version of HTML, and subsumes XHTML. The current standard, the HTML Living Standard is developed by WHATWG, which is made up of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), with the Living Standard also existing in an abridged version.</p>

          <h3>CSS3 Styling</h3>
          <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>

          <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
          <p>Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography, and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term "graphic design" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use typography, visual arts, and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging, and signage.</p>
